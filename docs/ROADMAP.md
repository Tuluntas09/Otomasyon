## Phase 0 — Documentation

**Scope:** Create all planning documents. Establish non-negotiable invariants in writing.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `PROJECT_BRAIN.md` written and reflects project identity.
- All `docs/` files present and internally consistent.
- `DECISIONS.md` contains D-013 through D-019.
- Human review completed and phase accepted.

**Status:** ✅ Accepted.

---

## Phase 1 — Empty skeleton

**Scope:** Create the repository structure, empty module boundaries, and the one
substantive test: the architectural invariant.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Git repository initialised.
- `README.md` with disclaimer present.
- All `backend/app/` module boundaries present as `__init__.py` with docstrings only.
- `backend/pyproject.toml` with pytest configured.
- `backend/tests/architecture/test_no_broker_no_execution.py` present and passing.
- `python -m pytest` from `backend/` returns `3 passed, 9 skipped`.
- No application logic in any module.
- `frontend/` empty shell with safety component placeholder.
- `ci/` stub present.

**Status:** ✅ Complete.

---

## Phase 2 — Data model + local storage

**Scope:** Define domain types, implement SQLite schema, and build the repository layer.

**Key deliverables:**
- `backend/app/core/models.py` — `Holding`, `WatchlistEntry`, `PriceRecord` domain types.
- `backend/app/core/validation.py` — typed validation (CurrencyError, NegativeQuantityError,
  DuplicateTickerError).
- `backend/app/data/adapters/base.py` — `DataAdapter` ABC.
- `backend/app/data/persistence/db.py` — DB init, schema DDL.
- `backend/app/data/persistence/holdings_repo.py`, `watchlist_repo.py`, `prices_repo.py`.
- Phase 2 unit and integration tests.
- `DECISIONS.md` updated with D-020 through D-024.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Architecture test still passes (`3 passed, 9 skipped` minimum — new tests add to count).
- All validation rules enforced and tested.
- Repositories round-trip correctly in in-memory SQLite.
- No CSV parsing, metrics, alerts, or API routes in this phase.

**Status:** ✅ Complete. Awaiting human review before Phase 3 begins.

---

## Phase 3 — CSV data adapter

**Scope:** Implement the CSV adapter that reads holdings and price CSVs and writes them to
the database via the repository layer.

**Status:** ⛔ Not started.

---

## Phase 4 — Metrics engine

**Scope:** Implement the pure metrics engine. M-001 through M-006 from `METRICS_SPEC.md`.

**Status:** ⛔ Not started.

---

## Phase 5 — Alerts + compliance guard

**Scope:** Implement alert rule evaluation and the compliance guard. All system-generated
text routed through the guard from this phase onward.

**Status:** ⛔ Not started.

---

## Phase 6 — Decision journal

**Scope:** Implement journal entry CRUD (append-only writes, queries).

**Status:** ⛔ Not started.

---

## Phase 7 — Reports + API layer

**Scope:** Assemble daily/weekly reports. Wire FastAPI routes for frontend consumption.

**Status:** ⛔ Not started.

---

## Phase 8 — Tier 3 gate review

**Scope:** Evaluate whether Tier 3 (paper trading research boundary) is appropriate.
This is a deliberate review gate, not a development phase. Tier 3 requires a new
`DECISIONS.md` entry and explicit human approval before any code is written.

**Status:** ⛔ Not started.
